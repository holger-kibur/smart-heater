# Smart Heater

## Overview
Smart heater is a small set of scripts that will automatically build and
execute a price-optimal heating schedule based on electricity market data. It
is designed to run on a Raspberry PI and toggle a water heater through a
configurable GPIO pin. It also relies on linux commands like "at" and "crontab"
to schedule itself.
